		  				<p>Whilst the subject matter might not appeal to most people, the technical challenge in creating a tool to allow people to get a detailed overview of a complex market were still significant.</p>
		  				<br />
		  				<p>The Insurance Times Top 50 was traditionally a printed piece. The move to digital allowed us to create a tool that gave people the chance to focus on their particular sector, and to compare themselves with their closest competitors.</p>

			  			<p>The graph was custom built in SVG, with object oriented Javascript handling the data and manipulating the graph and table behind the scenes. The drop-downs used the stunningly effective <a href="http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/">Chosen plugin</a> by Harvest.</p>
			  			<br />
			  			<p>Despite being data intensive, the project is completely stand alone and does not use a database. Instead, the data is stored as JSON that is processed by custom Javascript objects at run time.</p>
